# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
On this module I am helping an up-and-coming playwright, Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, Fever. She is estimating a budget of over $10,000 and she has hesitating jumping into her first fundraising campaign.

### Purpose
After using Excel to  organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data, it became useful to gain a greater understanding of campaigns from start to finish, so we noticed that Louiseâ€™s play, Fever, came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time and she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relations to their launch dates and their funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch date began with a Pivot Table based on Parent Category, to show only the data for "theater". Then, I placed the dates of Data Created Conversions with the number of outcomes of each month. In this way, I could see the story about the amount of outcomes of each month through the years.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
On this analysis it was necessary to make a table where we could relate the goals with the number of each outcome of the finished campaigns, hence, we only considered successful, failed and canceled outcomes. However, there are a several of different goals so we decided to organize them into ranges of $4,999.00. Then, made a counting of how many outcomes belong to each one of the intersection Columns (outcomes) and Rows (ranges of goals). After that, I made a Sum of the number of outcomes to get the total of projects of each range. Finally, I calculated the equivalent percentage of each amount of outcomes in every ranges, which helped me to make a Line Chart. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The analysis of outcomes based on Launch Date was not difficult. The process that I followed was very fluent because it was only necessary to make a Pivot table and a Pivot Chart. However, it was confusing to have the months of Date created conversions listed in the Row labels column.
In case of the Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals, it was a real struggle to put in action a function that had not been explained before, meaning COUNTIFS function. However, I could understand the syntax and use it without any problem.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Most of the successful campaigns are between March and September. So that, I would recommend to start the campaign between March and May, because on June it starts to decrease.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The chart represents redundant information. Due to the fact that it is made with the two percentages of the only two campaign outcomes, Succesful and Failed, whose sum equals 100% and results into a mirror line chart which ends up saying anything, 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Maybe, it is necessary to set a standard currency and it could be helpful to know the average age of the backers to have a notion of how to make the communications strategy. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Instead of the line chart with the percentage We could create a line chart with only que number of outcomes and even with only the total projects, where we could get from that most of the campaigns, succesful and failed, set goals between $10,000 and $4,999.
Also, we could do a Pivot table based on the Data Created Conversion and average donations which could tell us when people donate more.
Even we could do an analysis about the relation between average donation and Outcomes.
